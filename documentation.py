This module provides documentation for the Real-Time Multi-Modal AI Analytics System.

The system performs real-time analytics using multiple AI models. It integrates different types of data (text, image, audio, etc.) and applies appropriate AI models to analyze them in real-time. The system is designed to provide comprehensive analytics for complex scenarios like smart city monitoring, advanced business intelligence, or integrated healthcare systems.

Modules:
    data_ingestion: Handles the ingestion of data from various sources using Apache Kafka.
    data_preprocessing: Preprocesses the ingested data to make it suitable for analysis.
    model_selection: Selects the appropriate AI model based on the type of data.
    ai_models: Contains the AI models used for data analysis.
    real_time_processing: Handles the real-time processing of data.
    dashboard: Provides a web-based dashboard for displaying real-time analytics and insights.
    security: Implements robust security measures to ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations.
    optimization: Optimizes the system for performance and scalability.
    database: Handles the storage and retrieval of data.
    deployment: Handles the deployment of the system using Docker and Kubernetes.
    monitoring: Monitors the system performance and user feedback for ongoing improvements.

Usage:
    Run the real_time_processing module to start the system. The system will start ingesting data, preprocessing it, selecting the appropriate AI model, analyzing the data, and displaying the results on the dashboard.

    The system can be monitored and optimized using the monitoring and optimization modules, respectively. The deployment module can be used to deploy the system in a production environment.

    The security module ensures that the system is secure and that data privacy regulations are complied with.

For more information on each module, refer to the respective module's documentation.
